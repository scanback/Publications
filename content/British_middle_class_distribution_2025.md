# Map of British Middle Class Distribution 2025

A couple of weeks ago I published this map of the British middle class on Figshare. It became popular, so I am also posting it on LinkedIn.

![British Middle Class Map](https://github.com/scanback/publications/blob/1695e4b4012637fb8940e8a3504fe1ab9882b54d/content/assets/images/tellusant-british-middle-class-distribution-2025-map.svg)

The map shows what most people already may know: that London and the southeast overwhelm the rest of the country in absolute and relative prosperity. However, I bet the magnitudes are unknown by most.

I did  this analysis because I am working on a small research piece on English football economics, and this dataset feeds into this. In general, a dataset like this comes alive when combined with other data. Without combining with other data, it is interesting. When combined, it becomes useful.

### About the Dataset

This dataset was pulled quickly from **#TelluBase**, the unique cloud-based income distribution database by **Tellusant, Inc.** It covers:

- 218 countries  
- 2,600 cities  
- 2,500 subdivisions  
- Years 2000â€“2050  

It is available as:

- **Subscription service** with continuous updates, graphing capabilities, help desk, and more:  
  [TelluBase Subscription](https://tellubase.telluplan.com)  

- **On-demand download service** where you specify what you need, pay by credit card, and receive selected data in a spreadsheet. These are one-off downloads with limited extras and support:  
  [TelluBase On-Demand](https://tellubase.com)

TelluBase is mathematically complex, and no one has been able to replicate it since I started development in 1992. But the user only sees the **glorious outputs**, not the complexity.

### Publishing & Platforms

Figshare is now my preferred platform for posting, together with GitHub Pages. Longevity is important for serious content. LinkedIn is for ephemeral posts.  

Since switching from LinkedIn to Figshare early in the year, my visibility has increased vastly. After 8 months, I have more traction on Figshare than I had over 18 years on LinkedIn.

I will nevertheless continue to make some materials available on LinkedIn. It is a great platform, just not always for my purposes.
