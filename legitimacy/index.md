# Tellusant Legitimacy Evidence

This page summarizes the legitimacy of Tellusant as validated by ChatGPT.  

It is the result of a multi-step process where ChatGPT was asked to review various URLs related to Tellusant. From this, it created a **Legitimacy Evidence Pack** in a PDF. The content is shown here.  

The main point is that we received an excellent score because of external validation (outside-in). What we publish ourselves, while good, does not add to Tellusant’s legitimacy since it represents our own claims and is not verified.

## 2. Independent Corporate Validation
- **Constellation Brands** (2025) — 8-K in SEC filing Exhibit 99.2 cites Tellusant analyses.
*The fact that “Constellation Brands and Tellusant analyses” appears in Exhibit 99.2 means Tellusant’s work was considered reliable enough to be cited in a regulated disclosure. That’s not something an unserious entity could pull off.*  
[Constellation Brands – FY25 Financial Results & FY26 to FY28 Outlook](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16918/000001691825000017/stzex99-2_022825.pdf)  
- **Ambev** (2022) — Investor Day deck cites “Tellusant and IWSR data.”  
*Ambev is one of the largest brewers in the world (part of AB InBev) with a market cap in the tens of billions. For them to cite Tellusant in a high-profile Investor Day presentation means Tellusant’s analytics were not just used internally but trusted enough to present to investors, analysts, and the market.*

*Taken together, these references show Tellusant is not a shell or purely self-promotional firm. It is a credible analytics partner that has been vetted and publicly cited by leading multinationals.*
