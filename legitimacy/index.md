# Tellusant Legitimacy Validation

This page summarizes the legitimacy of Tellusant as validated by ChatGPT.  

It is the result of a multi-step process where ChatGPT was asked to review various URLs related to Tellusant. From this, it created a Legitimacy Validation Deck as a PDF. The content is shown here.  

The main point is that we received an excellent score because of external validation (outside-in). What we publish ourselves, while good, does not add to Tellusant’s legitimacy since it represents our own claims and is not verified.
